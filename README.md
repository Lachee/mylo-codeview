### Google Chrome
#### Chrome Store
This extension is not available on the chrome store. Being so specialised, I did not see the purpose of releasing it so publically. 
If there is demand for it, please let me know as I understand it can be a pain in the butt on Edge.

#### Manually
1. Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
2. In the top right, make sure Developer Mode is enabled
3. IN the top left, Load unpacked, then the built `dist/` folder or the unpacked .zip file

### Microsoft Edge
Edge will nag you about developer extensions, i do applogise.
1. Go to [edge://extensions](edge://extensions)
2. In the left navigation panel, enable developer mode
3. Load unpacked, then the built `dist/` folder or the unpacked .zip file
